        <p>{% trans %}Parliamentary monitoring organizations, or “PMOs,” are working to create strong, open and accountable parliaments, through enhancing citizen participation in the legislative process and bringing parliaments closer to the people they represent. OpeningParliament.org provides a forum for international collaboration on efforts to improve access to parliamentary information and share experiences and good practices among PMOs. It also serves as the home of the Declaration on Parliamentary Openness (link to ‘Declaration’ tab), a set of shared principles on the openness and transparency of parliaments being developed by the PMO community.{% endtrans %}</p>
